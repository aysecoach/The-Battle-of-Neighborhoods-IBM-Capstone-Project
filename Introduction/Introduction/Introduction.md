# The-Battle-of-Neighborhoods-IBM-Capstone-Project
Starting a specific business in a new place is a real challenge for an entrepreneur. Venue types around the place would be a good point to start business. If there are many categorical venues with the starting business around this place, there will be competitive cases and this will compel the entrepreneur in many different aspects. In addition, population of a borough will be another issue to take care. If population of the borough is higher, then the potential of the growth of this business will be higher too. Considering these two cases together, it can be possible to find the best borough to start a new business.

He should choose the best place to have high income and grow his business.
